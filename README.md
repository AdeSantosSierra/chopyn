Chopyn is an Artificial Intelligence system whose main capability is to create music.
Implemented in Python, Chopyn will be able to create music out of a given melody, design harmonies similar to a specific music
style and who knows what else...

Chopyn will be an open-source project, combining RNN, Deep Learning and the most cutting-edge AI technologies.
